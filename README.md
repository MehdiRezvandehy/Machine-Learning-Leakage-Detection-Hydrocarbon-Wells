The exploitation of hydrocarbon reservoirs may potentially lead to contamination of soils, shallow water resources and greenhouse gas emissions in cases where wells are not perfectly sealed. Fluids such as methane or CO2 may in some cases migrate towards the groundwater zone and atmosphere through and along hydrocarbon wells. Several well properties such as age, depth, production/injection history, well density, and deviation, among others, may influence the likelihood of fluid leakage. In this study, machine learning approaches were applied to predict serious leakage with uncertainty quantification for wells that have not been field tested in Alberta, Canada. An improved imputation technique was developed by Cholesky factorization of the correlation matrix between features. Next, a wide range of predictive algorithms and various performance metrics were considered to achieve the most reliable classifier. However, a highly skewed distribution towards the negative class (non-serious leakage) forces predictive models to unrealistically underestimate the minority class (serious leakage). To address this issue, a combination of oversampling and undersampling was applied to adjust the class distribution. In this notebook, Python implementation to prediction fluid leakage from Hydrocarbon Wells is presented in this notebook.
